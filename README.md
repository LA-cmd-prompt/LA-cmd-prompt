Privacy Compliance Portfolio 

Welcome to my Privacy Compliance Portfolio. 
This repository showcases practical, hands-on projects that demonstrate how I approach privacy compliance, data protection, and risk management under Canadian and global frameworks.  

My goal is to show not just knowledge of privacy laws like GDPR **PIPEDA** and **CASL**, but how I apply them through deliverables that organizations can use in real-world contexts.

##  Why This Portfolio Matters
Privacy compliance isn’t just about knowing the law—it’s about **operationalizing** it. Each folder in this repository demonstrates how I take frameworks and turn them into actionable deliverables, ready for use by organizations.

##  About Me
I’m a **privacy compliance professional** passionate about turning complex regulations into actionable programs that organizations can trust.  This repository showcases practical, hands-on projects that demonstrate how I approach privacy compliance, data protection, and risk management under Canadian and global frameworks.

I specialize in:  
-  **Privacy by Design** — embedding privacy into workflows and systems from the start  
- **DPIA & PIA** — structured risk assessments for data protection  
- **Incident & Breach Response** — playbooks for compliance with Canadian frameworks (PIPEDA, CASL)  
- **Privacy Policies & Vendor Audits** — practical tools businesses can adopt immediately
- **DSAR Automation** - eliminates manual process for data subject access rights ( user requests to access, correct, or delete their personal data).
