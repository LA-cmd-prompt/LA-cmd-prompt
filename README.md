Privacy Compliance Portfolio 

Welcome to my Privacy Compliance Portfolio. 
This repository showcases practical, hands-on projects that demonstrate how I approach privacy compliance, data protection, and risk management under Canadian and global frameworks.  

My goal is to show not just knowledge of privacy laws like GDPR **PIPEDA** and **CASL**, but how I apply them through deliverables that organizations can use in real-world contexts.
